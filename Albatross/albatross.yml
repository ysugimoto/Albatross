#
# "remap" field specifies physical key mapping using IOKit, value shold be [src]: [dest] format and key and value MUST be a single key.
# Key name is case insensitive (e.g "a" and "A" indicates the same key).
#
# Example
#
# ```
# remap:
#   a: b  <- remap "a" key to "b" key
# ```
#
# Note that this setting is enable globally using IOKit, all keyboard inputs always remaps for your setting.
# All keys spec is described at https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/technotes/tn2450/_index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/DTS40017618-CH1-KEY_TABLE_USAGES
remap: {}

# "alias" field specifies alias keys using CGEvent, register keyboard alias globally.
# The difference of "remaps" field is that alias setting is override hardware keyboard, just remap virtual keyboard event.
#
# The "global" field is global alias. These settings are enables for all apps.
# The "apps" field is application fileterd alias. These setiings are enabled only specific application is active and focused.
#
# Important:
#  * In this setting, key name is case sensitive. For example, CGEvent distiguishes "a" and "A" (differences shift key is pressed or not).
#  * App name is actual process name which is defined app.localizedName. It it hard to find, but you may find via Activity Monitor app.
#
# Example
#
# ```
# alias:
#   global:
#     - from: [Control, a]
#       to: [Command_L, a]
#   apps:
#     - name: "Google Chrome"
#     - from: [Esc]
#       to: [Command_L, n]
# ```
#
# Above setting registers:
#   - "Control+a" keys alias to "Left Command+a".
#   - "Esc" key alias to "Left Command+n" only in Google Chrome, it may open a new window
